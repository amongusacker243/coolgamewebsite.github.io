## about
seraph attempts to be a clean and easy-to-use solution for playing various online games without any unnecessary elements to it, such as advertisments or confusing user interface. unlike most other game hosting websites, seraph (when fully released) will have downloading support, meaning that you can download the entire website's code for yourself to run and play locally without worrying about being blocked out.
